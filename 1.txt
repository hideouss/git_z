remote branch: git remote 
remote branch(defaull) url: git remote -v
a remote branch(branch name) url: git remote show remote_branch_name
database objects: find .git/objects -type f
show o: git -cat-file -p SAH-1  
objects type: git cat-file -t SHA-1
objects type: annotated tag; blob; tree ; commit;
blob: not store file name  just store file content
tree: solve the issue of blob not store file name  and  could store a group of files together 
write blob object via internal: echo 'content' | git hash-object -w --stdin;     not -w only show hash  not store it in database
(echo 'content' > file name; git hash-object -w file name)
write tree object via internal: add files to index ; write index out to tree object 
add to index: git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 \ SHA-1 file name(add:file not exist in index  even no index yet
cacheinfo:adding files not exist in work directory but exist in database   100644:normal files)
git update-index --add filename(file in work directory)
git write tree from index/stage area:git write-tree   so create tree object first should stage files
staged: changes to be committed    use git rm --cached <file> to unstage 
create commit object: echo 'commit message' | git commit-tree SHA1
show index content: git ls-files --stage; 
tracked file(unmodified modified stage):git know   untracked file:git not know
git status:show work directory and stage area
commit format: top-level tree   parent commit if any    committer information    blank line   commit message 
git diff: compares work directory and staging area   result show changes has made that have not yet staged
git diff: what has changed but not yet staged(git diff)    what have staged are about to commit(git diff --staged)
